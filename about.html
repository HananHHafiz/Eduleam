  <img class="bulp" src="img/pulb.png" /> <h1>Welcome to Eduleam</h1>

<p>Raising a child is a very hard job. As parents, we face so many challenges down the road thinking and worrying about how to teach our precious kids and help them to learn and understand the different knowledge, and which way will be better to deliver and pass this knowledge to them, and can they enjoy the learning process or not. Many studies have proven that teaching children through pictures and sounds is one of the most effective way of learning. Likewise teaching children languages are one of the most difficult challenges many parents face. Arabic is a very unique language, and many people consider it one of the languages that is hard to teach and learn. As a media student in my last year I decided to create this website for children’s ebooks where the users parents or children can learn Arabic depending on their English background or practice Arabic as their first language and learn English through it.</p>
